The mpiexec command is used to execute a MOOSE-based application using MPI. For example, the tutorial application can be executed with the following syntax, where the -n 4 is an argument supplied to the mpiexec command that indicates to use 4 processors for execution:

cd ~/projects/babbler
mpiexec -n 4 ./babbler-opt -i test/tests/kernels/simple_diffusion/simple_diffusion.iCopy
In most cases, using MPI alone is the best coarse of action. If desired, threading may be enabled using the --n-threads option, which is supplied directly to the application executable. For example, the following runs the application with 4 threads:

cd ~/projects/babbler
./babbler-opt -i test/tests/kernels/simple_diffusion/simple_diffusion.i --n-threads=4
